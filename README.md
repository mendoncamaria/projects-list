# Projects Tracker

This website is built to keep a track of the projects i build and host online.

## About the Project

### Overview:

Developers in their early learning stage often develop and host websites that are hard to keep track. In my case, my portfolio is one page application and projects were taking a chunk in UI, so i separated it out totally to make it neater.

### Tech Stack

Typescript + Tailwind powered by Vite

### External Libraries

1. styled-components: For styling the components and page
2. zustand: For storing values
3. React-icons: for icons to add in card

### Deployment Platform

Vercel

## Note:

Do credit me if you plan to use this project.

<!-- ### UI Improvements can be done(strikes are done):
1. <p></p>
2. <p><s>Add anchor to Footer name and redirect to Portfolio</s></p>
3. <p><s>Add new Category for the quiz</s></p>
4. <p>In the end, show answers to Users to make them aware of right or wrong answers</p>
5. <p>Update Background, add relevant images</p>
